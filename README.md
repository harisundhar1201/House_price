# House Price Prediction

This data science project focuses on predicting house prices using a dataset containing various features and attributes related to residential properties.
By analyzing and modeling the data, the project aims to develop a predictive model that can estimate the sale prices of houses accurately.

# Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project consists of information about different residential properties. It includes a wide range of features that can potentially
influence the price of a house, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, neighborhood characteristics, and other relevant factors.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a robust predictive model for house price estimation.
By training the model on historical data and leveraging its learned patterns and relationships, it will be able to predict the prices of new or unseen houses accurately.

# Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
Techniques such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables will be employed to prepare the dataset for model training.
Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, random forests will be explored and evaluated to determine the most suitable model for accurate price prediction.

# Impact
Accurate house price prediction can have significant implications for various stakeholders, including homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors.
With an effective predictive model, prospective buyers can make informed decisions about property investments, sellers can set competitive prices, and agents can
provide better guidance to their clients. Additionally, investors can use the predicted prices to identify profitable opportunities in the real estate market.

# conclusion

1.From the analysis, we can see that the Random Forest Regression model performed better than the Ridge Regression model and Polynomial Regression model.
2.During the EDA process, we found out that the location of the house is a very important factor in determining the price of the house, since houese with
similar area and other features can have different prices depending on the location of the house.
3.The location of the houses has been plotted on the map using the longitude and latitude values which makesrole of location in determining the price of the house more clear.
